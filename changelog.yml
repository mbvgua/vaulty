    Modularize the application
    
    - refactored the api-v1 folder, moving each individual file into a
      folder. This is in preparation for building the UserPersonalInfo
      functionality that will be housed in similar location.
    - separated the app.ts from the server.ts to allow for testing logic to
      work

    Touched abit on the UD operations
    
    - Might need to redo the update endpoint, for scenarios whereby not all
      the values are present. It updated undefined values to the db, which
    is not present. Might look for a way to resolve this by placing
    placehholders in the frontend
    
    - rewrote both the userBasicInfo and UserPersonalInfo tables, creating a
      way to delete accs. after a certain timespan
    
    - removed unecessary update trigger and in-built that into the tables
      itself, however since it could not b possible with the CURRENT_DATE
    data type, had to build a tigger to do that automatically
    
    - More errors continue to show up in the auth controllers, and there is
      an evolving need to identify even more of them through testing and
    resolve where possible

    did the CR operations on the database
    
    next phase will involve working on the update and deacticate(delete)
    
    some bugs were identified manually in the loginUser controller, whereby
    if i were to input a username/email that does not exist, an error will
    be caught instead of returnng that that user does not exist. Will look
    on how to handle this while testing the application later on.
    
    Ofcourse the fragile premise being that i able to remember that ;(

    Used connection pools to query DB
    
    these help reduce time used in connecting to the db by using a previous
    connection and leaving it open when done instead of closing it.

    Created the first endpoint!!(technically 2nd)
    
    Created the register user endpoint in the rather simple way with no
    validation or authorization.
    
    Had to rewrite the database schema, in that the initial INT data type
    associated with the id column had to truncate the long uuid generated
    id. Converted this to VARCHAR(255) to house it without truncating it.
    
    build the routes and collections to help in eventual modularization of
    the application.

    Connected to the database
    
    After various failed attempts I was successful in connecting my backend
    to the MySql databse and perform a siple table query. The code is quite
    messy and jumpled up but I intend to modularise it in the next update.

    and returns a response. Now to connect to the database...

    ADDED THE VIEWS!
    
    which wasn't quite as hard as i thought as they only virtual tables. The
    functions proved abit difficult and thus were put off for a while. Was
    able to bundle the entire db-schema into a script and execute it
    seamlessly at one which was quite nice.
    
    Looking forward to begining work on the backend implemenattion tommorow.

    GOT A TRIGGER WORKING!!!
    
    No chatgpt was used in the making of this trigger. Pure documentation
    and mental fortitude. It was amazing, simple but amazing. Oh, and I also
    got a bunch of storedProcedures up and running. They had a very similar
    syntax to those from T-Sql, but not exactly.
    
    Also removed all 'IF NOT EXISTS' statements from the tables and stored procedures as they were made redundant in mysql v8.0.0 onwards.
    
    Anyway, day made!!!!
