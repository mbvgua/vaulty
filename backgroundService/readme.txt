Possible functions i could have here:

- reactivate acc
- verify email
- 


✅ 1. Email Verification (already on your mind!)
Send a unique token to the user's email after registration to verify their identity.

Trigger: After user registers
Tech: Nodemailer, BullMQ queue, Redis

🔐 2. Password Reset Token Email
When a user requests a password reset, send a time-limited link/token to their email.

Trigger: When forgot password is clicked
Extras: Auto-expire tokens via a cron job or TTL in DB

🔄 3. Session Expiry Cleanup
Automatically log out users after a certain period of inactivity, especially for security-sensitive sections.

Trigger: On an interval (e.g., every hour)
Tech: Cron job or Redis key expiry

⏰ 4. Account Deactivation & Auto-Deletion
Your app already allows users to deactivate accounts. You can automate permanent deletion after 7 days if not reactivated.

Trigger: Run daily to check for expired accounts
Tech: Node cron + MySQL/Redis check

📊 5. User Activity Logging / Audit Trail
Track when users log in, update their profile, etc., and store logs in a separate table.

Trigger: On user action
Use: For analytics or suspicious behavior alerts

🚨 6. Security Alerts
Notify users if:

They log in from a new device

Password gets changed

Suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., too many failed login attempts)

Trigger: After login or error events
Tech: Email + rate limiter

📦 7. Data Backup / Export
Allow users to request an export of their data (GDPR compliance), and email them a link when it's ready.

Trigger: On user request
Worker: Packages data into a file, stores in S3 or similar

🔔 8. In-App or Email Notifications
Welcome email

Weekly digest (e.g., activity summary)

App feature announcements

Trigger: Based on time or app actions
Tech: Node cron or BullMQ scheduler

👀 9. Inactive User Reminder
Send nudges to users who haven't logged in after a certain time (e.g., 14 days).

Trigger: Daily job scanning last login timestamps
Use: Boost engagement

👮 10. Rate Limiting & IP Banning
Track brute force login attempts and temporarily block suspicious IPs.

Trigger: After multiple failed logins
Tech: Redis for counters, IP ban list

🔄 11. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Token Generator
If you add 2FA (totally worth it for Vaulty), a background task can:

Generate OTPs

Expire them after a short window

🛠️ Bonus Tech Stack Suggestions
To manage background tasks:

BullMQ (w/ Redis): Job queues, retries, delays

Agenda.js: Mongo-backed job scheduling

node-cron: Lightweight cron jobs

Redis: Store TTL-based tokens and rate limits
